What Next?

- Dependabot checks weekly the dependencies in requirements.txt. If updates are available, it creates pull requests and sends alerts.

- Review the changes and ensure they don't break your app before merging. Dependabot will create pull requests, but itâ€™s up to the repo's CI/CD pipeline to run tests and check that the updates don't break the app.

- If a vulnerability is found in any of your dependencies, Dependabot attempts to update the dependency to the minimum required version to address the vulnerability and send you a pull request.

Automating dependency updates reduce vulnerabilities risks. This ensures the site remains secure and up-to-date with minimal manual oversight.
